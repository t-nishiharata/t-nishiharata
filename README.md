- 👋 Hi, I’m @t-nishiharata
- 👀 I’m interested in "Media Art" with a focus on generative art.
- 🌱 Current research interests include video production using generative AI and mixed media production that digitally processes analog works.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on someone to work with high school students on mixed media production, art production using generative AI, and the use of generative AI.
- 📫 How to contact me... call me with a thought of me.
